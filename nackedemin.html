        <p>
            At <a href="https://nackademin.se/utbildningar/virtual-reality-utvecklare/">Nackademin</a> I taught multiple classes in the field of VR development. Most noteworthy was the course "UX
            and Interaction design in VR" where I spent a month teaching interaction design, UX for virtual interfaces
            and real life implementation of it all in Unity. In a field where the rulebook is yet to be written I
            realized that you need to pay attention to human behavior exceptionally well in order to present your
            virtual content in a non-intrusive and understandable way.
<br>
            Other courses included "Mobile VR development" which in a time where Google Cardboard was on the way out and
            Quest on the way in, was very exciting to both research and teach.
