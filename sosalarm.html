        <h3>Lead developer for the SOS VR call center experience.</h3>
        <p>
            SOS Alarm provides Sweden with its national emergency number â€“ Every year they handle around 3.5 million
            emergency calls. Despite being a large organization there is great secrecy of what it's like to work there
            and even what their workplace looks like. With this VR-experience it's possible for the very first time to
            get an insight into SOS alarms operations.

            The main challenge in this project was to really grasp the details of SOS alarms work and to design a UX
            that users could learn in seconds. The simplicity of the control scheme also couldn't stand in the way of
            the need for fast actions and quick decisions the user would have to do in order to truly experience the
            feeling of working as a call center operator. The system I designed to acheive this ended up being very easy
            to pick up for new users and is one of the many things in this project that I think ended up as a success.
