    <main>
        <p>I’ve been a VR developer and an experience designer for approaching five years now. During this incredible time I’ve learned a lot. I’ve become an “expert” in many fields. Mainly because a big part of my role have been the task of replicating the world and businesses that exists in it. Everything from eye laser surgery, train operation, emergency call center operation to high voltage wiring.
            <br>
            I’ve also had the opportunity to develop my own craft during this time, I’ve become a good friend to Unity Engine and learned and developed some healthy coding routines.</p>
